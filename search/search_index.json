Issue categorization helps us know the friction points of our product. Powered with Zero-Shot-Classifier Model and list of predefined issue tags. Improving in-app help using data by making changes to the help screen so one can find answers faster. To make it easier to find the right answer after landing on the wrong search result, added 'Related articles.' such that related articles are semantically similar to the one you are currently reading. Then this entire flow of finding related articles is automated by Airflow.
